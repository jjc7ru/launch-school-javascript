  <h1>Hello, Internet</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com/">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the &quot;class&quot; attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph" id="last-paragraph">
    This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
  </p>
